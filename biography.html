        Hello, name is Jack Marshall. I was born in the 90's and grew up around photography. My mother and father were both photographers,
        so photography to me is not only a way to capture a moment and express feelings, but a way of life. I went to college at ASU and graduated
        with a bachelors degree in Digital Photography. In my free time, i enjoy playing basketball with old friends, spending time with family,
        and watching tv with my dogs.

        <h1>Why Weddings?</h1>
        <p>
        I chose to specialize in wedding photography mostly because I find weddings beautiful. It is what bonds two people for the rest of
        their lives. A wedding is a special day, and you want to capture those moments. One day you'll want to look back at the photos,
        whether its just randomly, or on a special occasion such as your anniversary. Regardless, a wedding is a special day,
        and you should want your photographer to be special, thats why you should choose me.
